## **Project Overview**
I worked on analyzing employee and job posting data using Microsoft Excel, focusing on data transformation, forecasting, and business insights. The project involved handling two datasets:

Employee Dataset – Containing personal, professional, and educational information of employees.
Job Posting Dataset – Including job posting dates, salaries, designations, and related details.
The project utilized Power Query for ETL, advanced Excel functions for analysis, and interactive dashboards for visualization.

## **Task: Data Cleaning & Transformation**
I cleaned and transformed the dataset by:

- **Using Power Query for ETL** : Merging, filtering, and shaping data from multiple sources.
- **Handling missing values** : Filling gaps in key fields to ensure data consistency.
- **Removing inconsistencies** : Standardizing job titles, salary formats, and categorical data.

## **Forecasting & Analysis Techniques**
To derive insights, I used various Excel functionalities:

- **Forecasting job postings** : Created a forecasting sheet to predict future job postings based on historical data.
- **What-If Analysis** : One-variable & two-variable data tables --> Analyzed base salary variations over five years under different bonus and raise percentages.
- **Goal Seek & Scenario Manager** : Compared different total compensation scenarios over time.
- **Lookup Functions** : Used VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP for cross-referencing data.

## **Dashboard & Visualization**
To present the findings effectively, I
Created multiple Pivot Tables to extract key insights.
Built an interactive dashboard with
slicers for dynamic filtering.
KPI Measures calculated using DAX queries.

## **Objective**
The objective of this project was to leverage Excel’s analytical capabilities for workforce planning and salary forecasting, providing valuable business insights.

Key areas of focus:

- Workforce trends
- Job posting analysis
- Compensation planning and forecasting
- Interactive data visualization

## **Learning Outcomes**
This project enabled me to:

- Performed ETL operations using Power Query.
- Applied advanced Excel functions for analysis.
- Used What-If Analysis, Goal Seek, and Scenario Manager for compensation planning.
- Built an interactive dashboards using Pivot Tables and DAX.
- Extracted business insights from large datasets efficiently.
